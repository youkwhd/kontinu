kontinu

Typed JavaScript library to create endless scroll with no
third-party dependency nor Web API involed.

Installing

Quick Start
-----------

To use kontinu, you can observe a HTML element that is the last
element. Then you can create a function to append more contents
to the DOM.

    kontinu.observe(lastElement, () => updateDOM());

To be more clear, see the Examples section.

required developement dependencies:
